## 🌐 Localization & 🎨 Theming

### Adding a New Language

Budgify uses the `intl` package for localization. Contributing a new language is simple:

1.  Navigate to the `lib/l10n/` directory.
2.  Copy `app_en.arb` and rename it to `app_<language_code>.arb` (e.g., `app_es.arb` for Spanish).
3.  Translate the values in the new file.
4.  Add the new locale to the `MaterialApp` widget in `main.dart`.
5.  Run `flutter pub get` to regenerate the localization delegates.

### Theming

The app supports both Light and Dark themes. The theme data is defined in `lib/core/theme/app_theme.dart`. You can customize colors, fonts, and component styles in this file.
